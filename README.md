A repo filled with stuff needed for a new machine! I'm mainly writing this for future me, but if you happen to be reading this, Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## New Machine Setup
I always end up forgetting or misplacing how/what to install on a new machine, so after picking up one of those shiny new M1 Mac's, I thought "Hey, let's automate the install of all of my stuff!".

Insert `Homebrew Bundle`!

Admittedly, I would have never of heard of this tool had I not listened to Casey Liss on my favorite podcast - [ATP](https://www.caseyliss.com/2019/10/8/brew-bundle).


First things first, installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
